## Tier 2: Serious Credits (Apply This Month) 💰💰💰

### 3. Google for Startups Cloud Program ⭐ **BEST OPTION**

**Option A: Partner with an accelerator** (Easiest)
These accelerators provide automatic access:

- Alchemist Accelerator
- Plug and Play
- Antler

**Option B: Direct application** (What you should do)
Apply directly: https://startup.google.com/programs/cloud-program/

**Your application strategy:**
```
Company: ChurnRisk.ai (or whatever name)
Stage: Pre-seed / Building MVP
Problem: $X billion wasted on customer churn in SaaS
Traction: 
  - First customer (FlexPoint) signed
  - POC completed
  - Revenue: $X MRR from first customer
Why GCP:
  - Building on Cloud SQL, Cloud Tasks, Cloud Run
  - AI/ML workloads using Vertex AI (even if you're not yet)
  - Multi-tenant architecture native to GCP
Funding: Bootstrapped (seeking $X seed round)
```

**Pro tips to increase approval odds:**
1. ✅ **Show revenue** - Even $1 MRR is better than $0
2. ✅ **Show a live product** - Deploy your POC to a public URL
3. ✅ **Use GCP actively** - Spend $50-100 before applying (shows commitment)
4. ✅ **Mention AI/ML** - Google prioritizes AI startups
5. ✅ **Have a domain + professional email** - churnrisk.ai, not Gmail
6. ✅ **Connect with a Google Cloud rep** - Get a referral (see below)

**Timeline:** 4-8 weeks approval

**Value:** $100,000 over 2 years ✅✅✅

**Your path:**
1. Once you validate with paying customers (not just FlexPoint)

**Timeline:** Immediate upon VC partnership

## Tier 3: Creative Approaches 💰

### 5. GCP Partnership Through Existing Relationships

**Option A: HubSpot Partnership**
- You're building a HubSpot integration
- HubSpot has a partnership with Google Cloud
- Reach out to HubSpot App Marketplace team
- Ask if they offer GCP credits for featured apps

**Email template:**
```
Subject: Partnership Inquiry - HubSpot Integration + GCP Credits

Hi [HubSpot Partner Team],

We're building ChurnRisk, an AI-powered churn detection app that 
integrates deeply with HubSpot. We're deploying on Google Cloud and 
targeting the HubSpot App Marketplace.

Does HubSpot have any partnership programs with GCP that could provide 
infrastructure credits for qualified app partners?

We're in POC stage with our first customer and expect to launch on 
your marketplace in Q2 2025.

Best,
Travis
```

**Value:** Potentially $10k-50k

---

### 6. Regional/Industry Programs

**Google Cloud for E-commerce/SaaS:**
- Google has vertical-specific programs
- Since you're targeting Shopify apps, check for e-commerce startup programs
- Apply: Mention "enabling Shopify ecosystem"

**Local startup programs:**
- Check if Columbus/Ohio has Google Cloud partnerships
- Many cities have "tech hub" programs with cloud credits

---

### 7. Education/Research Angle

**If applicable:**
- If you or Travis are still affiliated with a university
- Google Cloud Research Credits Program
- $1,000-$5,000 for "research" projects
- Frame churn detection as ML research

---

## Tier 4: Once You Have Traction 💰💰

### 8. Google Cloud Sales Team

**When to reach out:**
- After you have 10+ paying customers
- When you're spending $500+/month
- Before raising Series A

**What to do:**
```
1. Go to console.cloud.google.com
2. Click "Support" → "Contact Sales"
3. Say: "We're a fast-growing SaaS startup spending $X/month. 
   We're projected to hit $Y/month by EOY. Looking for startup credits."
```

**What you'll get:**
- Negotiated credits (often 20-50% of projected spend)
- Dedicated account manager
- Architecture reviews (free consulting)

**Value:** Variable, but potentially $20k-100k+
